# HUMAN FACTOR MITIGATION

## General :

### The operator should carry out an assessment of the human-machine interface and aspects governing crew coordination when using the EFB. Whenever possible, the EFB user interface philosophy should be consistent (but not necessarily identical) with the flight deck design philosophy. The review of the complete system should include but not limited to:

-   General considerations including workload, usability, integration of the EFB into the flight deck, display and lighting issues, system shutdown, and system failures;
-   Physical placement issues, including stowage area, use of unsecured EFBs, design and placement of mounting devices;
-   Considerations for interference with anthropometric constraints, cockpit ventilation, and speaker sound;
-   Training and procedures considerations, including training on using EFB applications, EFB policy and procedures manual, fidelity of EFB training device, and mechanisms for gathering user feedback on EFB use;
-   Hardware considerations;
-   Software considerations
