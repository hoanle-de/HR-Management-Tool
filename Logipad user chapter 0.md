-   Operators Employees,…

The main objectives of this Manual are:

-   To define the functional responsibilities in order to ensure the clarity of roles, authority and accountability of all persons in charge of the EFB Program.
-   To establish the administrative and operating procedures within the scope of the EFB Program in order to maintain and improve the co-ordination capability, as well as the performance and stabilization of methods and models of operation which are used in the Program.
-   To provide the guidelines for regulating the activities within the Program in order to achieve the Program’s objectives in conformance with the Company interest.
-   To provide a detail on the training matters relating to the EFB Program.
-   It shall be noted that EFB program (include operating procedures, pertinent training modules, checklists, operations manuals, training manuals, maintenance programs, minimum equipment lists (MEL), other pertinent documents, and reporting procedures) was build incorporated into Operators policy.

## DEFINITIONS

The following definitions are specific to this Manual and may differ from those definitions contained in other published references.

-   **Administrative Control Process:** Operator-administered procedures to control and record the EFB Program’s operations process
-   **Portable EFB:** Portable components supporting EFB applications are considered PEDs. For a PED to be considered an EFB, the PED must actively display Types A and/or B software application(s) (e.g., when a PED is displaying personal email, the PED is not considered an EFB; when the same PED is authorized and actively displaying a Type B aeronautical chart application, it is then considered an EFB).
-   **Installed EFB:** EFB equipment components supporting EFB applications are “installed” when they are incorporated into aircraft type design under 14 CFR part 21,AMC 20-25A or as a proper alteration under 14 CFR part 43, § 43.3.
-   **Type A Software Applications**: Have a failure condition classification considered to be no safety effect; Do not substitute for or replace any paper, system, or equipment required by airworthiness or operational regulations; and Do not require specific authorization for use (i.e., although the Type A EFB application is part of the operator’s EFB program, Type A EFB applications are not identified or controlled in the OpSpecs or Management Specifications (MSpecs)).
-   **Type B Software Applications**: Have a failure condition classification considered minor; May substitute or replace paper products of information required for dispatch or to be carried in the aircraft; May not substitute for or replace any installed equipment required by airworthiness or operating regulations; and require specific authorization for operational authorization for use (i.e., each Type B EFB application must be authorized by the FAA in
-   **Miscellaneous (non-EFB) software applications:** Miscellaneous software applications are non-EFB applications, supporting function(s) not directly related to operations conducted by the flight crew on the aircraft.
-   **Critical Phases of Flight:** Critical phases of flight in the case of aeroplanes means the take-off run, the take-off flight path, the final approach, the missed approach, the landing, including the landing roll, and any other phases of flight as determined by the pilot-in-command or commander.
-   **Electronic Flight Bag (EFB):** An EFB is any device, or combination of devices, actively displaying EFB applications. EFBs are characterized by the following: An EFB hosts applications, which are generally replacing conventional paper products and tools, traditionally carried in the pilot’s flight bag. EFB applications include natural extensions of traditional flight bag contents, such as replacing paper copies of weather with access to near-real-time weather information. In order to qualify as an EFB application, the failure effect must be considered a minor hazard or have no safety effect. Acceptable EFB applications are listed in section 1.2.2 These EFB applications may be overlaid or integrated. EFBs cannot replace any installed equipment required by operational or airworthiness regulations. EFB applications have no certification requirements for installation under aircraft type design.
-   **Electronic Flight Folder (EFF):** An EFF software contains flight plans, NOTAMS, weather charts, and additional flight information, for example, and the structure can be adapted as required. The look and structure of the Flight Folder can be aligned with the operations manual and briefing definition
-   **Hosted Application:** Software running on an EFB that is not installed or considered part of aircraft type design
-   **Interactive Information:** Information presented on the EFB that, via software applications, can be selected and rendered in a number of dynamic ways. This includes variables in the information presented based on data- oriented software algorithms, concepts of de-cluttering, and selectable composition as opposed to pre-composed information.
-   **Mounted:** Any portable device that is attached to a permanently installed mounting device
-   **Mounting Device**: A mounting device is an aircraft certified part which secures portable or installed EFB, or EFB system components.
-   **Stowed :** A portable device that is placed in a secure stowage location but is not available for use or view by the pilot in that location
-   **User:** means Pilots, Cabin Attendants, Dispatcher and Flight Operation Officer.
-   **Company iPad:** iPads which have been assign to individuals for their duty. Company iPads are certified as official devices to perform Operator’s EFB.
-   **Personal iPad:** iPads which are personal priorities,
-   **Warranty time:** 01 years starting from the date receiving a company iPad.
-   **Viewable Stowage** : A device that is secured on the flight crew (e.g. kneeboard) or in/to an existing aircraft part (e.g. suction cups) with the intended function to hold charts or to hold acceptable light mass portable devices (for example an EFB of no more than 1 Kg) viewable to the pilot at her/his required duty station. The device is not necessarily part of the certified aircraft configuration.

The term “must” is used to indicate mandatory requirements.

The terms “should” and “recommend” are used when guidance is recommended, but not required.
